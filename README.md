# Banabyte Community Server Rules

## What?
This repository hosts the rules for all our servers. The rules are automatically pulled to the website with a max refresh time of 5 minutes. This is because of github caching the raw version of the rules.

## Servers
- [SCP:SL](https://github.com/Banabyte/server-rules/blob/main/scpsl.md)
- [Gmod: Among Us](void;)
- [Rust](void;)
