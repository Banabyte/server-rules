# Family Guy DarkRP - Help Wanted
The reason this server has gone offline is that our developer has quit working on the project and has chosen to abandon the team with his crew. Leaving the code to go depreciated and obsolete upon the release of Family guy darkrp.

We've been working hard on recovering/reviving the project to bring back family guy darkrp, but we can't do it alone without the help of the community.

If you or someone you know is a developer, an ex-staff of a server, or an enturepenure trying to look for new projects to work on with us. please contact us at https://discord.gg/banabyte

With your help, we can progress the family guy darkrp server as well as other servers that will soon follow up along with this server.

Thank you for reading, and enjoy your stay at Family Guy DarkRP. - A true work that was once just a joke between 3 people.

# For the Players
If you are a player, and you want to help us support the project of Family Guy DarkRP. Feel Free to offer suggestions in our discord server located at https://discord.gg/banabyte

Otherwise checking in on the progress of the server bi-weekly would be greatly appreciated to show that you, the player, enjoy the content being added to the server.


# Future of family guy  From { V3 -> V4 }
we're removing all microtransactions added by our previous developer, which means paywalls, VIP ranks, Level systems, Special pay-to-use weapons, etc. - I didn't enjoy the system, same with returning players. 

> Our servers are supposed to be free to play and not pay to win, donations will be accepted but they will not provide any kind of advantage in the server. 

We're adding new characters into the Family Guy DarkRP
- Herbert the Pervert
- Standing Joe
- Weedmire
- Giant Chicken
- Meg Griffin
- Cop Joe
- and Carter Pewterschmidt

New jobs will be assigned to these characters once a new developer steps in on the project

That's all we have for now.
