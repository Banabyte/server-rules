# Family Guy DarkRP - Help Wanted
The reason this server has gone offline is because our developer has quit working on the project and has choose to abandon the team with his crew. Leaving the code to go depresiated and obsolete upon the release of Family guy darkrp.

We've been working hard on recovering/reviving the project to bring back family guy darkrp, but we cant do it alont without the help of the community.

If you or someone you know is a developer, an ex-staff of a server, or an enturepenure trying to look for new projects to work on with us. please conact us at https://discord.gg/banabyte

With your help, we can progress the family guy darkrp server aswell as other servers that will soon follow up along with this server.

Thank you for reading, and enjoy your stay at Family Guy DarkRP. - A true work that was once just a joke between 3 people.

# For the Players
If you are a player, and you want to help us support the project of Family Guy DarkRP. Feel Free to offer suggestions in our discord server located at https://discord.gg/banabyte

Otherwise checking in on the progress of the server bi-weekly would be greatly appriciated to show that you, the player, enjoy the content being added into the server.


# Future of family guy  From { V3 -> V4 }
were removing all microtransactions added by our prevous developer, which means paywalls, vip ranks, Level systems, Special pay to use weapons, etc. - I didn't enjoy the system, same with returning players. 

> Our servers are supposed to be free to play and not pay to win, donations will be accepted however they will not provide any kind of advantage in the server. 

Were adding new characters into the Family Guy DarkRP
- Herbert the Pervert
- Standing Joe
- Weedmire
- Giant Chicken
- Meg Griffin
- Cop Joe
- and Carter Pewterschmidt

New jobs will be assigned to these characters once a new developer steps in on the project

Thats all we have for now.
