# Family Guy DarkRP - Help Wanted
The reason this server has gone offline is because our developer has quit working on the project and has choose to abandon the team with his crew. Leaving the code to go depresiated and obsolete upon the release of Family guy darkrp.

We've been working hard on recovering/reviving the project to bring back family guy darkrp, but we cant do it alont without the help of the community.

If you or someone you know is a developer, an ex-staff of a server, or an enturepenure trying to look for new projects to work on with us. please conact us at https://discord.gg/banabyte

With your help, we can progress the family guy darkrp server aswell as other servers that will soon follow up along with this server.

Thank you for reading, and enjoy your stay at Family Guy DarkRP. - A true work that was once just a joke between 3 people.
