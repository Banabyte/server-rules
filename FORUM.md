## Welcome to Banabyte Forum
You were probably led here by a member of the server or have decided to seek interested in looking for a website online
No Matter, We welcome users with open arms and say welcome to our network.

### Here is the list of rules you have to follow

#### Rule 1: Be Respectful
- That means, treating every user with respect, whether you like their opinion or not, I think we should all get along pretty well.

#### Rule 2: Do not Spam
- Don't spam on the forum, although we welcome users, please use the forum properly.
- That means, No random pictures unless it's related to the topic
- That means, No random Self Promotions just to annoy people
- That means, No cluttering the chat room just to bump your conversation
- And that also means, Don't Clutter your profile with Ascii Characters

### Rule 3: Respect people for who they are
- Honestly, Respect people for who they are, and what they want to be, and, Respect what they do, even if you don't agree with it.
- This point was made plain and simple and I don't have to repeat myself on this subject.

### Rule 4: Self Promotions & Social Media
- Don't post about your social media, there is a place in your profile where you can add media links into your profile so that when someone looks at your profile, they can see that you have other platforms you are on.

### Rule 5: Don't Post NSFW/NSFL or anything related to it
- That's not allowed in the forum at all, take it to the [Discord Server](https://discord.banabyte.com) we now have an NSFW chat to pile that all into.

### Rule 6: No Politics or debate
- Keep the politics and debate to a minimum, Were not a server that politicizes today's problems, were just a community that is thriving on newer things, like my profile picture, and how you are all offended by it because it's a protogen and not something different.

> Other than that's pretty much wraps up things from here, leave a comment if you think I missed anything.
