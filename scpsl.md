### SCP:Banabyte Community Guidelunes 

[1] Using in-game exploit spots, which are normally unreachable, is prohibited. Spots that can be reached by jumping on intentional props/railings are allowed.

[2] Teaming that directly, or intentionally, leads to the death of teammates is prohibited. Staying in a room prolongedly is considered camping. Walking around in the same zone and staying in a corridor/tunnel are not considered camping.

[3] For MTF/Chaos:
  - Turning off generators.
  - Killing obedient, cuffed Class-D/Scientists.
  - Uncuffing Class-D/Scientists right before their escape. 

For SCPs:
  - Closing/locking doors on teammates.
  - Intentionally letting the Nuke go off when it would cause SCPs to lose the round.

For Scientists/Class-D:
- Cuff Trading (the act of uncuffing someone you have previously cuffed, and providing them with a weapon so that they may cuff you â€” enabling you to play on the opposite team), is permitted. 

Players should note that Cuff Trading will put them at risk of breaking our rules regarding Teaming [2] 
When, and if, this is the case, this will be left entirely up to the Moderator's discretion.

MTF/Chaos are free to kill people who are caught attempting to carry out these 'deals'.
