Banabyte Rules
(1) Don't provide info discovered unfairly outside of the game (meta-gaming).

(2) Harassment, racism, sexism, and toxic behaviour wont be tolerated.

(3) Don't use exploits (Our Servers are still in alpha).

(4) Don't delay rounds by camping.

(5)  advertising is allowed of any sort unless approved by someone of Director or higher.

[6] Any form of cheats/hacks will get you banned from all Pantheon servers.

[7] We accept mic-spamming in proximity provided it is at an appropriate volume. Mic-spam external to proximity chat must remain in-excessive and not be loud; this includes spectator chat, SCP chat, radio chat and intermission.

[8] Teaming is not allowed (this includes SCPs and Chaos Insurgency).
Our only exceptions for teaming are as follows:
- NTF, CI and Guards can disarm their enemies and escort them to the escape zone, however they must be detained at all times and cannot work with their captors.
- Class-D and Scientists can cooperate but cannot assist in killing their own teammates.
- SCP 079 is exempted from this rule but may only team with Class-D and CI.
